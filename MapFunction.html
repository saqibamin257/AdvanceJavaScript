         // **** Understanding JavaScript's map()
        //The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this array.
       //map takes two arguments, an array and a function. Usually, this is how you would call a function with two arguments:
      //map(myArray, myFunction);
     //But map is defined as an array method, meaning it’s an action that any JavaScript array can perform on itself. So instead, we call it like this:
    //myArray.map(myFunction);

       
               
        numberArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        //**************** program-1 *********************

       //The function taken as argument by map is known as the callback, because it’s called on every element in the original array.
        var incrementByOne = function (num) {
            return num + 1;
        }
        var newArray = numberArray.map(incrementByOne);

        //*************** program-2 *************************

        //So far we’ve had to separately define our callback function for every map. But JavaScript provides a handy shorthand in the form of anonymous functions.
        //Instead of defining the callback by itself, we define it inside the map:

        var newArray2 = numberArray.map(function (num) {
            return Math.pow(num, 2);
        });

        //**************** program-3 *************************
        var newArray3 = numberArray.map(function (num) {
            return num + 1;
        });

        //***************  program-4 **************************
        //by Fat Arrow Function

        //Recently, JavaScript introduced a new, shorter syntax to define anonymous functions, known as the “fat arrow” ES2015 (or ES6) syntax.
        //It lets you replace the traditional function (argument) {...} syntax with the much shorter:(argument) => {...}
        //And if you’re only taking in a single argument, you can even get rid of the () altogether: argument => {...}
        //This lets us rewrite our previous snippet as:

        myArray = [1,2,3,4];

        var newArray4 = myArray.map(num => {
            return num + 1;
        });

       //What’s more, if all you’re doing is returning a value you can shorten your code even further:

       var newArray5 = myArray.map(num => num + 1);
